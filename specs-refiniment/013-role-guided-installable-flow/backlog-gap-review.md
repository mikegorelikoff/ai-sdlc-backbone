# backlog-gap-review.md

## Feature Summary
- REQ-001: Replace the dual `_shared`/runtime authority with one installable canonical runtime.
- REQ-002: Route through exactly one active canonical role and preserve cross-role work as explicit handoffs.
- REQ-003: Load only the selected role reference and current workflow step while explaining context economics.
- REQ-004: Publish a breaking `ai-sdlc-flow/v2` card during the release-candidate line.

## Actors and Stakeholders
- Product Manager: owns customer problem, outcomes, and product trade-offs.
- Product Owner: owns delegated backlog ordering and acceptance clarity.
- Business Analyst: owns actor, workflow, rule, and exception analysis.
- QA Engineer: owns independent testability and quality-evidence recommendations.
- Software Engineer: owns technical design, implementation, validation, and engineering-risk escalation.
- Harness Maintainer: owns package compatibility, schemas, generated docs, and release validation.

## Scope and Boundaries
- In scope: canonical runtime consolidation; five neutral role contracts; selector registry; JIT steps; bounded config; V2 card; install and documentation validation.
- Out of scope: new installable role skills, a replacement navigator, fictional personas, arbitrary team-defined actions, permission expansion, deployment, or telemetry upload.

## Workflows and Failure Paths
- Clear intent -> requested action -> state/prerequisite resolution -> exactly one active role -> selected step -> V2 DecisionCard -> fingerprinted Apply.
- Ambiguous intent -> role/action menu; no mutation until resolved.
- Missing runtime -> fail with the exact companion install instruction.
- Selector/config/reference/state drift -> reject Apply and require a fresh Explore.
- Cross-role prerequisite -> preserve requested role/action and show the prerequisite owner as the next active role.

## Requirements and Business Rules
- BR-001: The installed skill inventory remains 44; role contracts are references, not entrypoint skills.
- BR-002: Exactly one `active_role` is emitted; other roles appear only in handoffs.
- BR-003: Package-owned role/action/skill and step mappings cannot be overridden by project configuration.
- BR-004: V1 cards are rejected with a rerun-Explore diagnostic.
- BR-005: Direct reading wins unless packed context retains every critical anchor and saves at least 15% net tokens.

## Data, Integrations, and Non-Functional Requirements
- Machine contracts use versioned JSON schemas; agent-facing status remains Markdown/TOON.
- Selector and referenced-step paths must stay within the installed flow skill and reject symlink escape.
- Context selector globs are repository-relative, bounded to 16..4000 tokens, and treated as untrusted evidence.
- Deterministic output and fingerprints must be stable for identical repository, selector, config, and intent inputs.

## Dependencies, Risks, and Constraints
- Depends on Skills CLI discovery by `SKILL.md`, the existing context engine, state machine, artifact/index helpers, and documentation generator.
- Risk RISK-001: removing `_shared` touches every deterministic helper import and CI path.
- Risk RISK-002: selector drift could route the right intent to the wrong owner or skill.
- Risk RISK-003: overly broad context selectors could recreate the unreadable context problem.
- Mitigation: schema coverage, import smoke tests, exact mapping tests, bounded JIT context, and full installation validation.

## Decisions, Assumptions, and Open Questions
- DEC-001 accepted: five role references, one active role, automatic selection with explicit override, menu only when unclear, bounded configuration, canonical runtime, and V2 hard cut.
- No blocking product questions remain; implementation evidence may refine technical details without changing these accepted boundaries.

## Success Measures
- AC-001: full and selective installations execute flow and SDD helpers without `_shared`.
- AC-002: clear requests select one role/action; ambiguous requests expose a deterministic menu.
- AC-003: JIT output names one current step and selected role reference and explains every skipped reference.
- AC-004: packed context is accepted only at 100% critical-anchor recall and >=15% net savings.
- AC-005: 44-skill inventory, docs generation, all skill tests, and installed workflow smoke pass.

## Source Coverage
- Sources consumed:
  - Active user feedback and accepted implementation plan dated 2026-07-27.
  - `skills/ai-sdlc-flow/SKILL.md` and `skills/ai-sdlc-flow/scripts/flow.py`.
  - `skills/_shared/` and `skills/ai-sdlc-shared-runtime/` packaging evidence.
  - `docs/roles/`, `docs/reference/skills-by-role.md`, and `docs/scripts/build_catalog.py`.
  - `specs-refiniment/013-role-guided-installable-flow/decision-log.md`.
  - `specs-refiniment/013-role-guided-installable-flow/discovery.md`.
  - `specs-refiniment/013-role-guided-installable-flow/prfaq.md`.
  - `specs-refiniment/013-role-guided-installable-flow/delivery-gap-review.md`.

## Planning Evidence
- The accepted plan and inspected repository provide enough detail to decompose implementation without inventing product intent.
- Evidence is the accepted plan, inspected repository contracts, and completed upstream Feature 013 artifacts.

## Gap Matrix
| Area | Gap | Evidence | Planning Impact | Severity | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Feature 013 area | No blocking gap | Accepted plan and repository inspection | Feature 013 planning impact | medium | Business Analyst |

- The matrix is bounded to the accepted Feature 013 scope and traces to DEC-001.

## Priority and Scope Gaps
- No blocking gap; keep global install verification and context economics inside the feature rather than deferring them.
- Evidence is the accepted plan, inspected repository contracts, and completed upstream Feature 013 artifacts.

## Dependency Gaps
- Skills CLI has no dependency resolver, so selective install documentation and failure diagnostics must include the runtime explicitly.
- Evidence is the accepted plan, inspected repository contracts, and completed upstream Feature 013 artifacts.

## Planning Verdict
- Ready for backlog decomposition.
- Evidence is the accepted plan, inspected repository contracts, and completed upstream Feature 013 artifacts.
