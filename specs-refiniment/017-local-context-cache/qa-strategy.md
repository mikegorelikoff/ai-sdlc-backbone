# qa-strategy.md

## Feature Summary
AI SDLC Harness maintainers and repository contributors need an optional local retrieval layer that reduces repeated broad reads while preserving deterministic skill execution. The MVP installs only on explicit module opt-in and provides local lexical search, typed relation expansion, context-pack assembly, inspection, verification, benchmarking, and safe direct-read fallback. It is graph-enhanced RAG, not a claim of full LLM-extracted GraphRAG parity.

## Actors and Stakeholders
Primary users are repository contributors and AI agents running installed skills. Maintainers own module compatibility and release gates; QA owns deterministic retrieval and context-economics evidence; Architecture owns future embedding or provider-backed GraphRAG adapters; Security owns authority and untrusted-content boundaries. No remote service or external data processor is required by the MVP.

## Scope and Boundaries
In scope are an opt-in context-cache module, SQLite FTS5 lexical retrieval, deterministic line chunks with document and heading context, typed repository relations, bounded expansion, TOON receipts, context-pack v4 integration, incremental rebuilds, integrity verification, benchmarks, documentation, and installer coverage. Out of scope are mandatory installation, hidden network calls, alternate machine format interchange, autonomous authorization, vector-provider lock-in, LLM entity extraction, community summaries, and global GraphRAG search.

## Workflows and Failure Paths
A user opts into the module, builds or refreshes the index, queries or requests a context pack, and receives ranked evidence with source paths, hashes, authority labels, and stable fingerprints. Changed and deleted files update transactionally. Unsupported FTS5, stale fingerprints, corrupt indexes, missing StepCards, incomplete critical-anchor recall, poor token economics, unsafe paths, or insufficient evidence produce a TOON failure receipt and direct-read recovery instead of partial context.

## Requirements and Business Rules
FR-001 through FR-010 define optional installation, deterministic discovery and indexing, lexical and graph retrieval, v4 context assembly, authority preservation, safe fallback, verification, and evaluation. BR-001 forbids alternate machine format contracts; BR-002 treats retrieved content as evidence only; BR-003 requires the owning StepCard and all critical anchors; BR-004 requires deterministic ordering and stable tie-breaks; BR-005 forbids release claims without benchmark evidence.

## Data, Integrations, and Non-Functional Requirements
The local SQLite database stores repository-relative document metadata, content fingerprints, deterministic chunks, FTS rows, and typed edges. Inputs are repository files, Git metadata when available, skill StepCards, trace IDs, and query constraints. NFRs require offline operation, same-transaction index consistency, deterministic output, bounded traversal, no secret indexing, 100 percent critical-anchor recall, at least 15 percent net savings for packed mode, and TOON-only portable receipts.

## Dependencies, Risks, and Constraints
The MVP depends on Python standard-library SQLite with FTS5, the shared context-pack v4 contract, module-aware installation, Git-aware discovery, and existing TOON codecs. Main risks are stale or inconsistent indexes, lexical recall gaps, overclaiming GraphRAG, prompt injection in repository text, excessive index cost, and misleading token-savings estimates. Each risk has a deterministic fallback, verification check, benchmark, owner, and release gate.

## Decisions, Assumptions, and Open Questions
DEC-001 selects an optional SQLite FTS5 module. DEC-002 selects contextual lexical retrieval as the offline baseline. DEC-003 names the MVP graph-enhanced RAG and defers full GraphRAG. DEC-004 integrates with context-pack v4 and direct-read fallback. DEC-005 preserves instruction hierarchy. DEC-006 defines incremental fingerprinted indexing. DEC-007 sets 100 percent mandatory-anchor recall and a 15 percent net-savings packed-mode threshold. OQ-002 owner is Architecture; impact is limited to post-MVP semantic recall; next step is a provider-neutral adapter evaluation. OQ-003 owner is Product and Architecture; impact is limited to future global search; resolution is deferred until MVP benchmark evidence exists.

## Success Measures
The release gate requires deterministic repeated outputs and fingerprints, 100 percent mandatory StepCard and critical-anchor recall, no unsafe or excluded file ingestion, successful stale and corruption recovery, stable module installation, and passing golden queries for exact IDs, cross-file relations, and failure paths. Packed mode must show at least 15 percent estimated net token savings; otherwise the expected successful result is explicit direct_read. Live-model quality evaluation remains optional and separate.

## Test Scope
In scope are module install, file discovery, exclusion rules, contextual chunking, clean and incremental index parity, transaction rollback, FTS ranking, typed edge extraction, bounded expansion, StepCard and critical-anchor context assembly, token economics, authority labels, stale and corrupt recovery, inspect/verify/purge, benchmarks, docs, compatibility, and TOON-only contracts. Embeddings, remote providers, and global GraphRAG are out of scope.

## Risk and Coverage Priorities
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Coverage Layer | Priority | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mandatory anchor loss | Medium | Critical | Unit; integration; UAT | P0 | QA |
| Stale or partial FTS state | Medium | High | Integration; regression | P0 | Dev |
| Unsafe content gains authority | Low | Critical | Security; negative | P0 | Security |
| Ranking or graph nondeterminism | Medium | High | Unit; benchmark | P0 | QA |
| Weak lexical paraphrase recall | Medium | Medium | Golden evaluation | P1 | Architecture |

## Layer and Suite Strategy
Unit tests cover path filters, chunk IDs, ranking, edge extraction, pack thresholds, and TOON rendering. Integration tests cover SQLite transactions, incremental convergence, corruption recovery, and installer opt-in. Smoke proves build-query-pack-verify. Regression protects default install and v4 contracts. UAT demonstrates token-efficient exact and cross-file discovery. Security tests cover secrets and instruction injection.

## Test Data Strategy
Use deterministic temporary repositories with fixed file contents, mtimes ignored in semantic fingerprints, explicit trace IDs, repeated terms, cross-file imports and path links, and known mandatory anchors. Generate changed, deleted, corrupt, excluded, and adversarial variants from fixed fixtures. Do not use production repositories, credentials, network calls, or provider responses in the deterministic gate.

## Environment Dependencies
Python and SQLite FTS5 are the only runtime prerequisites for the MVP. Git improves tracked-file discovery and object evidence but untracked files still use content hashes. Tests require writable temporary directories and repository scripts; they do not require Docker, a vector database, network access, API keys, or external services.

## Automation Strategy
Automate every P0 behavior in unit or integration suites and expose one TOON benchmark command suitable for CI. Run deterministic modes twice and compare ordering and fingerprints. Keep manual checks for terminology, human readability, and inspected context usefulness. A future live-agent tier may measure answer quality but cannot replace the offline contract gate.

## Strategy Risks
Lexical retrieval can miss paraphrases, token estimates approximate provider accounting, and small fixtures can overstate savings. Mitigate with diverse exact and cross-file golden queries, explicit limitations, direct_read fallback, repository-scale performance measurement, and a future optional embedding evaluation. No unmeasured benefit is promoted as a release guarantee.
