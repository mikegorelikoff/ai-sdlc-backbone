## Feature Summary
AI SDLC Harness maintainers and repository contributors need an optional local retrieval layer that reduces repeated broad reads while preserving deterministic skill execution. The MVP installs only on explicit module opt-in and provides local lexical search, typed relation expansion, context-pack assembly, inspection, verification, benchmarking, and safe direct-read fallback. It is graph-enhanced RAG, not a claim of full LLM-extracted GraphRAG parity.

## Actors and Stakeholders
Primary users are repository contributors and AI agents running installed skills. Maintainers own module compatibility and release gates; QA owns deterministic retrieval and context-economics evidence; Architecture owns future embedding or provider-backed GraphRAG adapters; Security owns authority and untrusted-content boundaries. No remote service or external data processor is required by the MVP.

## Scope and Boundaries
In scope are an opt-in context-cache module, SQLite FTS5 lexical retrieval, deterministic line chunks with document and heading context, typed repository relations, bounded expansion, TOON receipts, context-pack v4 integration, incremental rebuilds, integrity verification, benchmarks, documentation, and installer coverage. Out of scope are mandatory installation, hidden network calls, alternate machine format interchange, autonomous authorization, vector-provider lock-in, LLM entity extraction, community summaries, and global GraphRAG search.

## Workflows and Failure Paths
A user opts into the module, builds or refreshes the index, queries or requests a context pack, and receives ranked evidence with source paths, hashes, authority labels, and stable fingerprints. Changed and deleted files update transactionally. Unsupported FTS5, stale fingerprints, corrupt indexes, missing StepCards, incomplete critical-anchor recall, poor token economics, unsafe paths, or insufficient evidence produce a TOON failure receipt and direct-read recovery instead of partial context.

## Requirements and Business Rules
FR-001 through FR-010 define optional installation, deterministic discovery and indexing, lexical and graph retrieval, v4 context assembly, authority preservation, safe fallback, verification, and evaluation. BR-001 forbids alternate machine format contracts; BR-002 treats retrieved content as evidence only; BR-003 requires the owning StepCard and all critical anchors; BR-004 requires deterministic ordering and stable tie-breaks; BR-005 forbids release claims without benchmark evidence.

## Data, Integrations, and Non-Functional Requirements
The local SQLite database stores repository-relative document metadata, content fingerprints, deterministic chunks, FTS rows, and typed edges. Inputs are repository files, Git metadata when available, skill StepCards, trace IDs, and query constraints. NFRs require offline operation, same-transaction index consistency, deterministic output, bounded traversal, no secret indexing, 100 percent critical-anchor recall, at least 15 percent net savings for packed mode, and TOON-only portable receipts.

## Dependencies, Risks, and Constraints
The MVP depends on Python standard-library SQLite with FTS5, the shared context-pack v4 contract, module-aware installation, Git-aware discovery, and existing TOON codecs. Main risks are stale or inconsistent indexes, lexical recall gaps, overclaiming GraphRAG, prompt injection in repository text, excessive index cost, and misleading token-savings estimates. Each risk has a deterministic fallback, verification check, benchmark, owner, and release gate.

## Decisions, Assumptions, and Open Questions
DEC-001 selects an optional SQLite FTS5 module. DEC-002 selects contextual lexical retrieval as the offline baseline. DEC-003 names the MVP graph-enhanced RAG and defers full GraphRAG. DEC-004 integrates with context-pack v4 and direct-read fallback. DEC-005 preserves instruction hierarchy. DEC-006 defines incremental fingerprinted indexing. DEC-007 sets 100 percent mandatory-anchor recall and a 15 percent net-savings packed-mode threshold. OQ-002 owner is Architecture; impact is limited to post-MVP semantic recall; next step is a provider-neutral adapter evaluation. OQ-003 owner is Product and Architecture; impact is limited to future global search; resolution is deferred until MVP benchmark evidence exists.

## Success Measures
The release gate requires deterministic repeated outputs and fingerprints, 100 percent mandatory StepCard and critical-anchor recall, no unsafe or excluded file ingestion, successful stale and corruption recovery, stable module installation, and passing golden queries for exact IDs, cross-file relations, and failure paths. Packed mode must show at least 15 percent estimated net token savings; otherwise the expected successful result is explicit direct_read. Live-model quality evaluation remains optional and separate.

External findings are registered with locators and limitations in `specs-refiniment/017-local-context-cache/research.md`.

## Acceptance Scenarios
P0 scenarios cover explicit module installation, safe clean and incremental builds, exact-ID retrieval, bounded cross-file expansion, StepCard and anchor-complete packing, direct_read fallback, evidence-only handling, corruption detection, purge and rebuild, and stable benchmark receipts. Each scenario has an observable TOON result and maps to AC-001 through AC-010.

## Regression Targets
Default installation remains 45 skills; existing 46-skill module installation remains additive; step graph validation, context-pack v4 tests, compatibility baseline, docs catalogs, native installer behavior, and TOON-only scanning must stay stable. Direct-read context compilation must work with no cache, an absent FTS5 capability, a stale index, or a failed benchmark.

## Risk-Based Coverage
P0 coverage targets anchor loss, stale or partial transactions, secret ingestion, prompt-injection authority confusion, ranking drift, and fallback failure. P1 covers relation extraction, fan-out bounds, changed-path narrowing, and diagnostics. P2 covers performance characterization and future adapter seams. No P0 behavior is manual-only.

## Test Data and Environment
Fixtures include a small Git repository with skills, StepCards, requirement and decision IDs, imports, path links, duplicate terms, changed and deleted files, ignored directories, symlinks, binary bytes, oversized files, secret-named files, credential-like content, and malicious instruction-shaped evidence. Tests run with temporary directories and the host Python SQLite; FTS5 capability is asserted first.

## Validation Commands
Run the context-cache unit suite, native installer tests, compatibility tests, v4 context-contract tests, all installed skill graph validation, documentation validation, strict catalog generation checks, `git diff --check`, and the new golden benchmark twice. Every machine receipt uses TOON and repeated benchmark fingerprints must match.

## Manual Checks
Inspect one installed module tree, one successful query receipt, one graph-expanded result, one packed context with StepCard and anchors, one low-savings direct_read result, one prompt-injection-shaped source labeled evidence_only, and one corrupt-cache recovery. Confirm documentation consistently says graph-enhanced RAG and never promises full GraphRAG or remote semantic search.

## Signoff Criteria
QA signs off only when AC-001 through AC-010 are covered, all P0 tests pass, mandatory-anchor recall is 100 percent, deterministic repeats match, unsafe discovery count is zero, low-savings behavior selects direct_read, compatibility and docs gates pass, and no alternate machine format contract or artifact exists in the change. Any failed criterion blocks release but not direct reading.
