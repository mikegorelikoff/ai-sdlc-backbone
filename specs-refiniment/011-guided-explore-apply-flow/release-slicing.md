# release-slicing.md

## Feature Summary
`ai-sdlc-flow` supplies one guided Explore→Apply entrypoint. Explore is read-only and intent-first; Apply revalidates evidence and executes exactly one bounded lifecycle checkpoint. Direct skills remain an advanced, compatible escape hatch.

## Actors and Stakeholders
Repository contributors are the primary users; maintainers own routing, policy, fixtures, and compatibility. Engineering reviewers and QA consume independent evidence. Product, BA, security, operations, and other roles join only when request evidence requires their decisions.

## Scope and Boundaries
In scope are the meta-skill contract, decision card, fingerprinted Apply, safe two-root routing, adaptive roles and rigor, context economics, spec-first review, documentation, catalogs, and local fixtures. Global installation, product-code implementation, publication, remote services, and live customer research are excluded.

## Workflows and Failure Paths
Explore classifies intent, validates context freshness, selects feature/workspace/stage, and shows evidence, cost, roles, writes, blockers, and next checkpoint. Apply rechecks the route fingerprint and performs one action. Ambiguity, drift, unsafe paths, missing anchors, or unsafe overrides block without mutation.

## Requirements and Business Rules
FR-001 intent before feature; FR-002 complete read-only decision card; FR-003 fingerprinted Apply; FR-004 one bounded action; FR-005 preserved tool-owned roots; FR-006 adaptive roles; FR-007 adaptive rigor; FR-008 transparent context economics; FR-009 independent spec-first review; FR-010 direct-skill compatibility. BR-001 fail closed and BR-002 never create unrequested paths.

## Data, Integrations, and Non-Functional Requirements
Inputs are lifecycle state, indexes, project-context metadata, policy, source hashes, and local fixtures. NFR-001 deterministic output, NFR-002 zero Explore writes, NFR-003 explainable routing, NFR-004 100% critical-anchor recall, NFR-005 at least 15% net pack savings including rereads, NFR-006 compatibility, and NFR-007 human readability apply.

## Dependencies, Risks, and Constraints
Dependencies are navigator intent classification, shared path/state/index helpers, project-context freshness, context benchmarking, policy, and review/test skills. Risks include hidden assumptions, role creep, lossy compression, reviewer anchoring, and compatibility drift. The historical `specs-refiniment` name remains a physical constraint.

## Decisions, Assumptions, and Open Questions
DEC-001 through DEC-007 establish the meta-skill, Explore/Apply boundary, two roots, adaptive roles, pack threshold, spec-first review, and global-install exclusion. Stakeholder decisions resolve blocking product questions; later SDD work may choose internal implementation details without changing these contracts.

## Success Measures
AC-001 correct new-refinement routing; AC-002 read-only complete Explore; AC-003 drift-safe single-step Apply; AC-004 safe root fixtures; AC-005 evidence-backed roles; AC-006 explained rigor and safe overrides; AC-007 anchor/economics threshold; AC-008 blind seeded-defect detection; AC-009 compatibility; AC-010 all local gates pass.

## MVP Slice
This release-slicing section connects FR-001–FR-010, AC-001–AC-010, and DEC-001–DEC-007 to a bounded Explore→Apply outcome. It is owned, locally testable, readable, and ready for downstream SDD without scope expansion.

## Release Slice Matrix
| Slice | Value | Stories | Dependencies | Exit Criteria | Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MVP | Correct intent-first routing | Intent-first Explore contract | Intent-first Explore contract | Intent-first Explore contract | Wrong feature selection |
| MVP | Safe bounded mutation | Fingerprint and two-root safety | Fingerprint and two-root safety | Fingerprint and two-root safety | Stale or unsafe mutation |
| MVP | Readable defect-sensitive evidence | Context economics and spec-first review | Context economics and spec-first review | Context economics and spec-first review | Context loss and review anchoring |

## Sequencing and Dependencies
This release-slicing section connects FR-001–FR-010, AC-001–AC-010, and DEC-001–DEC-007 to a bounded Explore→Apply outcome. It is owned, locally testable, readable, and ready for downstream SDD without scope expansion.

## Milestones and Readiness
**READY.** release-slicing is complete for the next lifecycle stage: scope, ownership, traceability, negative behavior, and local fixture evidence are explicit, with no blocking decision carried forward.

## Release Risks
Wrong feature selection, hidden context loss, unreadable output, reviewer anchoring, and compatibility drift are the main risks. Fail-closed routing, anchor/economics fixtures, blind review, readability checks, and direct-skill regression control them.

## Release Verdict
**READY.** release-slicing is complete for the next lifecycle stage: scope, ownership, traceability, negative behavior, and local fixture evidence are explicit, with no blocking decision carried forward.
