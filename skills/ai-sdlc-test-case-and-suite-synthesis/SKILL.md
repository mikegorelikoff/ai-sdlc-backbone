name: ai-sdlc-test-case-and-suite-synthesis
description: Use when QA scope and strategy are defined and you need to generate detailed, executable test cases plus smoke, regression, and user acceptance suites tied to requirements, roles, workflows, and risks. Supports `--quick-flow` for fast assumption-driven execution and `--full-flow` for question-driven verified execution. Explicit full or end-to-end spec refinement requests continue through the existing 18-stage refinement cascade.

# ai-sdlc-test-case-and-suite-synthesis: Test Case And Suite Synthesis

> Internal AI SDLC skill, not client-facing by default.
> Every rule below is important to follow. None of it can be skipped.
> Before producing the final artifact, confirm required inputs, target audience, missing facts, output format, and constraints when they are unclear.
> Do not invent missing information. Ask concise clarification questions when required inputs are absent.

## Step Selector

This table is generated from `steps/manifest.toon`. The manifest and linked
step documents are canonical; regenerate this projection after graph changes.

| Step | Ready when | Depends on | Operation | Load |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `preflight` | `prepare` | none | `inspect-and-route` | [`steps/01-prepare.md`](steps/01-prepare.md) — `required` |
| `context` | `clarify`, `route` | `preflight` | `compile-context` | [`steps/02-context.md`](steps/02-context.md) — `required` |
| `execute` | `execute` | `context` | `execute-procedure` | [`steps/02-execute.md`](steps/02-execute.md) — `on-demand` |
| `validate` | `validate` | `execute` | `validate-evidence` | [`steps/03-validate-and-handoff.md`](steps/03-validate-and-handoff.md) — `before-completion` |
| `handoff` | `handoff`, `complete` | `validate` | `handoff-result` | [`steps/04-handoff.md`](steps/04-handoff.md) — `before-completion` |

## Progressive Disclosure Contract

- Resolve the phase entrypoint and dependency-ready set with
  `ai-sdlc-shared-runtime/scripts/ai_sdlc_steps.py`; never invent a step path.
- Read only the emitted StepCard and its selected context. Pass completed step
  IDs back to the selector before requesting the next ready node.
- Treat `direct_read` as an explicit context strategy. Block only when mandatory
  evidence or critical anchors are missing.
- Explore is read-only. After Apply, journal every selected owning-skill step,
  including analysis and validation nodes, before advancing the graph.
- In source use `skills/<skill>/...`; use `.agents/skills/<skill>/...` for
  Codex, `.claude/skills/<skill>/...` for Claude Code, or the project skills
  root recorded in `.ai-sdlc/harness-install.toon` for `agent-project`.
