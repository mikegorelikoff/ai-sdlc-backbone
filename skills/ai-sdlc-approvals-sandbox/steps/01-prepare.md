# Prepare — ai-sdlc-approvals-sandbox: Approvals And Sandbox

> Selector: prepare, clarify, or route

## Entry

Confirm the requested scope, flow mode, canonical workspace, required evidence, active lifecycle state, and safe runtime layout before acting.

## Procedure

### 0.1 Required Inputs

- Exact command structure that failed or requires external access, with every
  credential and secret-bearing value replaced by `<redacted>` before capture.
- Task reason for the command.
- Sandbox error, expected restriction, and risk profile.

### 0.2 Clarification Rules

- Resolve discoverable facts and reuse inherited decisions before asking.
- Missing optional context stays optional; label assumptions explicitly.
- Pause only work dependent on a missing material input or conflicting requirement.

### 0.2.1 Flow Mode Flags

- Support `--quick-flow` and `--full-flow`; full takes precedence. Apply the shared execution contract below.


### 0.3 Output Rules

- Keep output structured with headings and bullets.
- Make findings, gaps, risks, and blockers explicit.
- Tie recommendations to evidence from the provided artifact, repository, `specs-refiniment/<feature-name>/<file.md>` workspace, or user context.
- Include role ownership when the output creates follow-up work for BA, QA, Dev, PM, or Delivery.
- Return progress, completion, validation, and handoff summaries directly in the active agent response.
- Before the final response, emit the `ai-sdlc-handoff/v2` contract with `result`, `blockers`, `next_required`, and `next_optional`; every action includes `reason`, `command`, and `expected_artifact`.
- Do not create `summary.txt`, `*-summary.txt`, or another standalone summary file unless the user explicitly requests one.
- Keep durable writes limited to the canonical lifecycle artifacts, decision log, human-readable index, and `_ai_sdlc` machine files.
- Let shared helpers migrate legacy paths on the next write; never overwrite or manually merge divergent legacy and canonical files.

### 0.3.1 Credential Boundary

- Preserve enough command structure to assess scope, shell operators, and the
  proposed prefix, but redact secret-bearing values before the command reaches
  any prompt, approval request, tool argument, log, decision record, or output.
- Never place a raw credential, bearer token, private key, password, webhook
  secret, signed URL, session identifier, or production-only value in an
  escalation record. Use `<redacted>` and describe the value's role separately.
- If safe redaction would make the command impossible to review, stop and ask
  the user for a sanitized command. Do not echo the unsafe input back.

### 0.4 Artifact Routing

- Maintain a feature decision log whenever this skill records, resolves, changes, or depends on a product, delivery, QA, security, validation, branching, implementation, or rollout decision.
- For PM, BA, QA, Delivery, discovery, planning, refinement, and readiness work, write decisions to `specs-refiniment/<feature-name>/decision-log.md`.
- For developer implementation SDD work, write decisions to `specs/<feature-name>/decision-log.md`.
- Each decision-log entry must include date, decision, context or evidence, options considered when relevant, owner, status, and links to affected artifacts, tasks, tests, or validation evidence.
- Use this exact decision-log structure:

  ```markdown
  # Decision Log

  | ID | Date | Status | Owner | Decision | Context/Evidence | Options Considered | Affected Artifacts | Validation/Trace Links |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | DEC-001 | YYYY-MM-DD | proposed / accepted / superseded / rejected | role or name | concise decision | source facts, artifact links, or evidence | option A; option B; recommended default | affected docs, tasks, code, tests, or rollout notes | requirement IDs, test IDs, validation commands, PRs, commits, or tickets |
  ```

- Use `specs/` only for developer implementation SDD packages and repo-governance artifacts.
- Do not place PM, BA, QA, Delivery, discovery, planning, refinement, or readiness outputs in `specs/`; those belong at `specs-refiniment/<feature-name>/<file.md>`.
- When consuming `specs-refiniment/<feature-name>/<file.md>`, treat it as upstream refinement context and create or update `specs/` only when implementation work is explicitly in scope.

## 0.4.1 Runtime Path Resolution

- Treat `skills/` in commands as a logical skill root. In a harness source checkout, use `skills/`; in a project-scoped consumer installation, resolve it to `.agents/skills/`. Before running a helper, verify that the selected root contains both this skill and `ai-sdlc-shared-runtime`; block with the missing path if neither layout exists.

## 0.5 Feature State Machine

This skill is not a required feature lifecycle stage. Do not invoke
`state_machine.py check/begin/complete` for it or create `_ai_sdlc/state.toon`
merely to run it. Use its declared helper and artifact contract. It may inspect
existing lifecycle evidence; only the registered owning stage changes that
state. Return the result and blockers to the caller without advancing a feature.

## 0.6 Artifact Metadata And Metatags

For canonical lifecycle Markdown, use the shared Harness metadata contract.
The owning writer maintains `artifact_metadata`, `metatags`, current sources,
validation and status. Do not mark planned or missing evidence as validated.

## 0.7 Specs Index

- Before searching across feature folders, inspect the compact LLM index first: `specs-refiniment/_ai_sdlc/specs-index.toon` for refinement work or `specs/_ai_sdlc/specs-index.toon` for implementation work.
- Use the human-readable index at `specs-refiniment/<feature-name>/index.md` or `specs/<feature-name>/index.md` when reporting feature coverage, artifact inventory, or handoff status to people.
- After this skill creates or materially updates an artifact, refresh the matching workspace index with `python3 skills/ai-sdlc-shared-runtime/scripts/ai_sdlc_specs_index.py --workspace <refinement|implementation> --quick-flow|--full-flow`.
- In `--quick-flow`, rely on `specs-index.toon` to choose the smallest relevant artifact set before opening files.
- In `--full-flow`, verify the updated artifact appears in both `specs-index.toon` and feature-local `index.md` before final handoff.
- The specs index summarizes artifact metadata and state; it does not replace reading the selected source artifacts when details, approvals, or validation evidence matter.

## Execution contract

Do not use it to decide product, delivery, or security risk. Use the owning lifecycle skill and accountable human policy instead.

Read the [shared execution decisions](../../ai-sdlc-shared-runtime/references/execution-contract.md) once for this invocation.
Apply its required/discoverable/inherited/optional input rules to this step's
declared inputs. Record the source and status of material facts, then validate
the owning output contract and current evidence before completion.

## Exit

Proceed only when inputs, authority, state prerequisites, artifact routes, and context boundaries are explicit; otherwise return the blocker or clarification.
